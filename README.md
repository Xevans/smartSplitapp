# smartSplitapp Zane 2 branch
Group Term Project: web app for sending money and splitting bills with friends (Django framework)

This branch exists as my personal extension of this web app. The purpose of this project is to enhance my understanding and explore more tools in Django with a focus on front-end development. 

This branch is based off the "xavier2" branch with all the updated features and will focus mainly on creating a more user friendly and modern UI.
