run virtual environment: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
super user creds: admin admin
additional users: xavier123, D******13#

setting up venv:
1. in powershell run 'python -m venv .venv'
2. run .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
2.5 if you get a script running denial/error run this line: 'Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser Unrestricted' then try step 2 again
3. when in venv, pip install python, black, and django
    3.1 python -m pip install black
    3.2 python -m pip install django

Commands:
- Run server: python manage.py runserver
- Create a new app: 'python manage.py startapp appName'

Thoughts...
User account system. Will need a user model and a profile model that imports user
Profile model will hold process related info

The custom user tutorial is an alternative way to handle logins and logouts. We will want to replace the old login system with the custom one.
We can then assign more fields to a user like email, DOB, username, password, etc. Do not run server or migrate or existing auth stuff will clash.

New login system tested and working with a super user, and an account form myself.
The next step is to delete the database and create more feilds to ubtain from the user at sign up.
